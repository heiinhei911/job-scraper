Asia Tech Reporter,The Financial Times (HK) Ltd,,False,Hong Kong,Administration & Office Support,,2024-08-05,74927828,https://hk.jobsdb.com/job/74927828,"['The roleThe Financial Times', 'nVidia', 'Intel', 'Samsung', 'TSMC', 'Luxshare', 'Huawei', 'Lenovo', 'AI', 'nVidia']","The roleThe Financial Times is seeking a thoughtful and well-sourced reporter to expand its coverage of the technology supply chain in Asia. We are open to a range of locations but the crucial requirement is an ability to get inside, and then explain for sophisticated business readers, what is going on in one of the most vital parts of the global economy: the chip companies and assemblers that underlie the world’s biggest tech products, from smartphones to AI.Semiconductors are perhaps the most intricate and complex technology yet devised by humanity. Our readers are fascinated by the corporate giants of the industry, such as nVidia, Intel, Samsung and TSMC; they want to understand how technology is evolving and what that will mean; and they care about the geopolitical dynamics that are increasingly shaping how the business works. Perhaps the best place to cover semiconductors is Taiwan, but there is also a case for South Korea, Japan or other Asian centres.Component suppliers and outsourced assemblers such as Hon Hai, Pegatron and Luxshare, meanwhile - as well as the sprawling network feeding into them, including the makers of displays and myriad other components - offer a different opportunity to break technology news. Coverage could extend to Huawei, Lenovo and China’s broader effort to build up its technology industry. Taiwan, Hong Kong or mainland China would be natural locations.Whatever the precise location and focus, news is the heart of the job - and we will expect the correspondent to break stories with their reporting and interviews - but we also want and expect them to write across a range of formats, from sharp analysis to magazine features, with an eye for the big picture. You may also be asked to represent the FT at events and in the media.Your skillsThe core of the job is writing and reporting. We want a writer who is in constant dialogue with sources in the technology industry and who listens to what they say, rather than imposing an outside narrative. In an industry that can be secretive in the extreme, that calls for first-rate reporting skills. A genuine interest in technology and the people who create it will go a long way.The FT is not a technology publication, however, so you will need to understand the business and financial context of the industry: our readers want to make sense of the latest innovations in AI chipmaking, but they also want to know what it will mean for nVidia’s share price. You will have the ability to combine all of these threads in clear, vivid writing.You will be expected to work closely with the rest of the Asia team. Staff across the region contribute to our technology coverage and collegiality is a central part of the FT’s culture: they will help to stand up your tips and expect the same from you. Good communication skills are important. You should regularly pitch ideas to editors in Hong Kong and deliver copy when promised.Skills in Asian languages, especially Mandarin, would be highly advantageous.Please submit your application by the end of the day, Wednesday 17th April 2024. "
